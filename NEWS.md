# IntakeInspectR (development version)

* 'By Cow' cleaning now uses biologically relevant thresholds of rate of intakes for each feeding event. The original statistical approach can also be applied if desired.

* Added more user inputs to 'By Cow' that allow users to interact with the new outlier detection logic.

* Changed column names for user upload csv/txt files to match our facility's data pipelines.

* Added 'custom column names' feature that lets users define the names used in their original file to be renamed for use in the Shiny app. However, column names can already be defined when using the package functions in R independently of Shiny.

* Change all 'cow' references to 'animal' to signify that this package will work with any animal data, not just dairy cows.

* Modified the layout of the cleaning pages of the shiny app (2a and 3a ) with the Log, Data Structure and a View Table page now separated into a navbar.

* Included download options for the 'By Bin' cleaning page, similar to what was available on the 'By Animal' page.
